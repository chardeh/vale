      <h4>
        Salma Abdelattiff or as i prefer to call you Umi or Ya Hayati, u deserve to be loved properly and fully and i want to be the person
        that gives you that love. You shouldnt have to tell me how I should show
        that, i need to know that myself. I know you're going trough a lot right now
        and me not being there for you and acting like this surely is not helping. I do genuinely care and love you and I believe that us meeting was meant to happen. Ever since I prayed Istikhara and Allah made you appear in my dreams I believed u were my Naseeb and i still do and I hope u feel the same about me
        hope u can forgive me. PS: sorry its the same as the valentine day 1,
        but i did change the song for u. I love you<3
